# Bank Customer Churn EDA and Prediction

**Overview:**
Bank Customer Churn EDA and Prediction is a data science project that combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to gain insights into customer behavior and forecast potential churn in the banking sector. The project utilizes machine learning algorithm "Random Forest", visualizations, and an interactive user interface to provide a comprehensive solution for understanding and addressing customer churn.

## Key Features:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset to unveil patterns, trends, and correlations.
- Identified pivotal features influencing customer churn.

### 2. Data Visualization:
- Visualized EDA results through a variety of charts and graphs.
- Developed interactive visualizations for an intuitive exploration of churn-related insights.

### 3. Predictive Modeling:
- Implemented a predictive model using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm.
- Trained the model on historical customer data to forecast future churn risks.
- Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics.

### 4. User Interaction:
- Created a Streamlit-based interactive interface, enabling users to explore the dataset seamlessly.
- Enabled real-time prediction of customer churn based on user inputs.

### 5. Contact Us Form:
- Integrated a user-friendly "Contact Us" form for inquiries and submissions (backend work pending).
