# Bank Customer Churn EDA and Prediction

**Overview:**
Bank Customer Churn EDA and Prediction is a data science project that combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to gain insights into customer behavior and forecast potential churn in the banking sector. The project utilizes machine learning algorithm "Random Forest", visualizations, and an interactive user interface to provide a comprehensive solution for understanding and addressing customer churn.

**Key Features:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Thorough analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.
   - Identification of key features influencing customer churn.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualization of EDA results using various charts and graphs.
   - Interactive visualizations for a user-friendly exploration of churn-related insights.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Development of a predictive model using machine learning algorithm "Random Forest".
   - Training the model on historical customer data to predict future churn risks.
   - Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Streamlit-based interactive interface for users to explore the dataset.
   - Real-time prediction of customer churn based on user inputs.

5. **Contact Us Form:**
   - Integration of a "Contact Us" form for user inquiries and submissions. (backend work is left as of now.)
